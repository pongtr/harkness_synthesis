# SYNTHESIS OF HARKNESS TOWER BELLS

Final project for CPSC 432, Sound Synthesis  
Programmer: Pong Trairatvorakul  
Submitted: May 3, 2016

This project focuses on recreating the bells of Harkness tower by additive synthesis with the main focus on the decay portion of the sound. Recordings of individual bells of Harkness were made (available in recorded_harkness) and analyzed using SPEAR. The analysis was then used to generate sound in Haskell, utilizing the Euterpea library, by additive synthesis. Exported sound files are in the folder "synthesized_sounds" with subfolders for sound with both attack and decay, attack and decay reversed, and just decay. Finally, the sounds were imported into Logic Pro to create an instrument and example pieces using the sound are available in "example_pieces".

The full writeup is also available in this repository.
